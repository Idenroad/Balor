# Balor – Idenroad Legion

[Version française](README_fr.md)

<img width="1920" height="461" alt="Idenroad_logo_horizontal_black" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ddbef27-f290-4aa9-942b-ee8e7dbdd298" /> <br><br>

**Balor** is a pentesting overlay built on top of [CachyOS Handheld Edition](https://cachyos.org/), designed for portable machines (Steam‑Deck‑like devices, Lenovo Legion Go, laptops, mini‑PCs).  
We used to rely on [BlackArch](https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch) but compatibility issues forced us to patch many packages.  
We decided to optimize the installation of a smaller, opinionated set of tools we actually use, by forking some BlackArch files and using AUR or CachyOS repositories directly.

**Idenroad** adds a **legion** of pentest and OSINT tools, organized into **stacks** that can be cleanly enabled or removed.

Goal: turn a clean CachyOS base into a **portable offensive platform**, scripted, reproducible, without trashing the whole system.

---

## 🎯 Concept: Overlay on top of CachyOS Handheld Edition

Balor does **not** replace CachyOS:

- You start from a standard **CachyOS Handheld Edition** install.
- The Idenroad overlay adds:
  - per‑stack install / uninstall scripts,
  - minimal integration to avoid polluting the system,
  - an offensive focus (WiFi, OSINT, BLE, remote, etc.).

You keep:

- the optimized kernel, performance and tooling from CachyOS,
- and you add an **offensive “Legion” layer**.

---

## 🛡️ “Legion” Concept

The **Legion** idea: a curated set of tools, tested and integrated, rather than a huge bag of random packages.

- Each *legion* = a thematic **stack** (WiFi, OSINT, Password, Remote, etc.).
- Each stack:
  - has its own `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`,
  - uses a `packages.txt` file to declare dependencies (`pacman:` / `aur:`),
  - avoids side‑effects (NetworkManager, Java, system services, etc.),
  - can be added or removed without breaking the rest.

---

## 🎯 Global objectives

- **compatibility**: tools patched for CachyOS Handheld Edition.
- **user‑friendly**: per‑stack install/uninstall, no need to be an Arch/AUR guru.
- **reproducibility**: same machine + same script ⇒ same result.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

- A working **CachyOS Handheld Edition** installation.
- Root / `sudo` access.
- Internet connection (packages + AUR).

### Steps

1. **Clone Balor on your machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idenroad/Balor.git ~/pentesting
   cd ~/Balor
   ```

2. **Run the global installer:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **From the main script, enable the stacks you want.**

4. **Enjoy your portable Legion.**

### Option 4: Full system upgrade

One option in the script allows you to **upgrade everything**:

- CachyOS core,
- installed packages,
- Balor tools.

> ⚠️ Warning: this affects the **whole system**, like a full Arch/CachyOS upgrade.  
> Use it only if you know what you’re doing.

---

**Target platforms:** Lenovo Legion Go, Steam Deck and other handhelds / laptops.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (next legions)

Some ideas for future stacks / legions:

- **BLE / RF**: tools like `btlejack`, basic NRF / RF analysis.
- **Reporting**: report templates, small artifact‑collection scripts.
- **Forensics / light IR**: post‑exploitation analysis tools, log / artifact collection.
- **Doc / Cheatsheets**: offline helper stack for working on the go.

## 🛠️ Quickstart: WiFi + OSINT pentest with Idenroad

### Scenario: WiFi audit + OSINT on a target

1. **Start an evil twin with roguehostapd:**

   ```bash
   sudo roguehostapd -i wlan1 -e "FreeWiFi" -c 6
   ```

2. **Run a captive portal with wifiphisher:**

   ```bash
   sudo wifiphisher -aI wlan1 -e "FreeWiFi"
   ```

3. **Run theHarvester on a target domain:**

   ```bash
   theHarvester -d example.com -b all
   ```

4. **Launch Maltego (with a working Java setup):**

   ```bash
   maltego
   ```
